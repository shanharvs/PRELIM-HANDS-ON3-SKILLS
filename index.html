    <h2>SKILLS</h2>

        I have a habit of reading multiple books at the same time, as I enjoy switching between different genres depending on my mood.<sup>1</sup>
This allows me to explore various perspectives and keep my reading experience dynamic and engaging.<sup>2</sup>
Although it may seem overwhelming, I have developed a system to track my progress in each book without getting confused, I’d use the Goodreads app for it.<sup>3</sup>
My ability to multitask in reading extends to other areas of my life, such as studying and working on different tasks simultaneously.<sup>4</sup>
One of my skills is that I am good at cramming, especially when deadlines are approaching; nobody really gets the adrenaline rush when the deadline is around 11:59p.m. .<sup>5</sup>
While it may not be the ideal way to study, I have learned how to absorb information quickly under pressure.<sup>6</sup>
This skill has honestly helped me navigate last-minute situations effectively, whether in academics or other responsibilities.<sup>7</sup>
Beyond academics, I consider empathy one of my strongest traits, as I can deeply understand and share the feelings of others, its like there’s a switch in my head on what will I do to others.<sup>8</sup>
Empathy allows me to connect with people on a meaningful level and offer support when they need it most.<sup>9</sup>
Along with empathy, I practice tolerance, as I believe that respecting different viewpoints and experiences is essential in any interaction.<sup>10</sup>
Even when I disagree with someone, I strive to listen and understand their perspective before responding, and listening to both sides helps me to know about their reasons on why they did a certain action. <sup>11</sup>
My knowledge of human nature helps me read people’s intentions and emotions, allowing me to navigate social situations effectively.<sup>12</sup>
This awareness makes it easier for me to adapt to different environments and anticipate how people might react.<sup>13</sup>
Interaction ability is another strength of mine, as I can engage in conversations with various types of people.<sup>14</sup>
I enjoy meaningful discussions, exchanging ideas, and learning from others through interaction.<sup>15</sup>
At the same time, I recognize that not every relationship or connection is meant to last.<sup>16</sup>
Because of this, I have learned the importance of cutting off people who drain my energy or negatively impact my well-being.<sup>17</sup>
It is not always an easy decision, but prioritizing my peace and mental health is necessary.<sup>18</sup>
I believe that surrounding myself with the right people is just as important as letting go of those who no longer align with my growth.<sup>19</sup>
Ultimately, my skills and traits shape who I am, helping me navigate life with a balance of knowledge, understanding, and self-preservation.<sup>20</sup>

<h2>HOBBIES</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-indent: 70px; margin: 30px;">
        In the morning after waking up, it is mandatory for me to stretch in order for my muscles to loosen and let the blood flow.<sup>1</sup>
        Stretching helps me feel more awake and prepares my body to start the day with energy.<sup>2</sup>
        With the feeling of hopefulness in my heart, I wish that everything will go smoothly throughout the day.<sup>3</sup>
        With that thought, I wake up feeling energized and ready to take on whatever comes my way.<sup>4</sup>
        One of the first things I do is drink chamomile tea, which helps calm my mind and ease me into the morning.<sup>5</sup>
        The warmth of the tea soothes me, allowing me to gather my thoughts before fully engaging with the day.<sup>6</sup>
        I take a moment to appreciate the quiet morning atmosphere, as it is the most peaceful time for me.<sup>7</sup>
        Around 12 p.m. in the afternoon, I usually write in my diary, which has become a habit I cherish.<sup>8</sup>
        Putting my pen to use, I ink the paper with all my thoughts, ideas, and plans for the day.<sup>9</sup>
        Writing in my diary allows me to reflect on my emotions and organize my priorities.<sup>10</sup>
        It also serves as a way to document my journey, so I can look back and see how much I have grown.<sup>11</sup>
        Sometimes, I write about the books I am reading or the dreams I had the previous night.<sup>12</sup>
        There are days when my diary entries are filled with excitement, while other days they contain deep reflections on life.<sup>13</sup>
        I believe that journaling helps me clear my mind, making it easier to focus on important tasks.<sup>14</sup>
        Aside from planning my day, I use my diary to write short poems or random thoughts that inspire me.<sup>15</sup>
        After finishing my entry, I feel a sense of relief, as if I have unburdened my mind.<sup>16</sup>
        At times, I go back and read previous entries, which allows me to see patterns in my thoughts and behaviors.<sup>17</sup>
        This habit has made me more self-aware and has helped me develop a greater understanding of myself.<sup>18</sup>
        No matter how busy my day gets, I always make sure to set aside a few minutes to write.<sup>19</sup>
        For me, writing is not just a habit—it is a ritual that brings me clarity, peace, and a sense of control over my day.<sup>20</sup>

<h2>INTERESTS</h2>
         <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 15px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-indent: 70px; margin: 30px;">
            Therefore, my interests revolve around books, and I find great joy in exploring different genres.<sup>2</sup>
            Reading every book out there is like soothing my soul, and I can guarantee that it brings me the utmost happiness.<sup>3</sup>
            Although I’m more into reading fiction books, my choices often depend on what interests me or the mood I’m in on a particular day.<sup>4</sup>
            I usually read romance genres, but I’ve always challenged myself to explore books outside my comfort zone.<sup>5</sup>
            I read fantasy genres to expand my imagination, and I dive into classics to strengthen and deepen my vocabulary.<sup>6</sup>
            However, what I don’t particularly enjoy about reading fantasy is that each book often introduces a new world, and understanding its structure is necessary to grasp the plot.<sup>7</sup>
            Genres that I admittedly find intriguing are crime and thrillers, as I love scenes so intense that I can’t put the book down, sometimes forgetting to eat or do other tasks.<sup>8</sup>
            What also interests me is going outside the house alone, without listening to music, as it feels intimate and allows me to reflect on life.<sup>9</sup>
            I am also interested in playing different games, and when I become obsessed with one, I can easily spend an entire day on it without realizing I haven’t accomplished anything else.<sup>10</sup>
            Coincidentally, I enjoy watching anime and reading manga or manhwa, which are illustrated stories that bring narratives to life in a different way.<sup>11</sup>
            I think reading these types of books is a great way to visualize specific events, making the storytelling even more immersive.<sup>12</sup>
            Ironically, I also love reading fantasy-based manga and manhwa because, unlike novels where you rely on imagination, these stories already have vivid illustrations.<sup>13</sup>
            Beyond reading, I occasionally indulge in writing short stories or journaling my thoughts, as it helps me process emotions and ideas.<sup>14</sup>
            I also enjoy discussing books with friends or fellow readers, as sharing perspectives often leads to deeper insights about the stories.<sup>15</sup>
            When I read a book with a compelling plot twist, I find myself rereading certain pages just to analyze how the author built up to that moment.<sup>16</sup>
            Sometimes, I even annotate my books, underlining thought-provoking quotes or making notes in the margins.<sup>17</sup>
            Despite my love for physical books, I also appreciate e-books, as they allow me to carry an entire library wherever I go.<sup>18</sup>
            I have an ever-growing list of books I want to read, and no matter how many I finish, the list only seems to get longer.<sup>19</sup>
            At the end of the day, reading isn’t just a hobby for me—it’s a passion that shapes the way I see the world and fuels my curiosity for more stories.<sup>20</sup>
